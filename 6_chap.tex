\par All the experiments were conducted in a Windows 7 Machine with 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD. We chose Python as our primary language. Python 3.5.0 with open-cv were primarily used for all image processing tasks. Table \ref{table:python_packages} lists all the python packages used and their purpose.
