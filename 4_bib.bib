	abstract="Image spam is unsolicited bulk email, where the message is embedded in an image. Spammers use such images to evade text-based filters. In this research, we analyze and compare two methods for detecting spam images. First, we consider principal component analysis (PCA), where we determine eigenvectors corresponding to a set of spam images and compute scores by projecting images onto the resulting eigenspace. The second approach focuses on the extraction of a broad set of image features and selection of an optimal subset using support vector machines (SVM). Both of these detection strategies provide high accuracy with low computational complexity. Further, we develop a new spam image dataset that cannot be detected using our PCA or SVM approach. This new dataset should prove valuable for improving image spam detection capabilities.",

	abstract="Thesupport-vector network is a new learning machine for two-group classification problems. The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.",
