\chapter{Datasets}
Three datasets have been used in this research. Two of these datasets are public datasets, images from actual spam and ham emails exchanged. 

\section{Dataset 1}
This dataset was developed by writers of Image Spam Hunter~\cite{3} at Northwestern University. After cleaning the dataset, 920 spam images and 810 ham images were retained for the research. All the images are in jpg/jpeg format.

\section{Dataset 2}
Dredze et. al in their paper Learning Fast Classifiers~\cite{10}, created an image spam corpus which is publicly available. After cleaning the dataset,  
1089 spam and 1029 ham images were retained for research. All the images are in jpg/jpeg format.

\section{Dataset 3}
Since very few public image spam corpuses are available, a synthetic dataset was created. Another public corpus from Dredze et. al in their paper Learning Fast Classifiers~\cite{10} included only spam images. After cleaning the dataset, and retaining only jpg/jpeg images, and experimental dataset is constructed. The aim of creating this dataset is to defeat the detection schemes used earlier.
