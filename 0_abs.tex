\par Electronic mail or email is one of the most common digital communication tools.  Spam is unsolicited bulk emails. Spam text embedded inside images can be loosely defined as Image Spam or Image-based spam. Image spam can bypass standard signature based detection schemes. Image spam has thus become a threat to email based communication. In this research, we propose an approach to image spam detection classifiers that are built using a combination of image processing and machine learning techniques.
